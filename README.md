## Voucherify React Demo Store - "Hot Beans"

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/62df72a1-2bdb-4fbe-b5c7-35c5106e29bc/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/voucherify-react-demo-site/deploys)

for production mode you should run in the project directory

`npm start`

and the entire app is served from port 3000

for development mode you now need to run two processes (i.e. 2 terminal tabs):

`npm run dev-server`

this will start your server at localhost:3000 (it'll restart automatically upon any changes in server.js)

`npm run dev`

this will start react-scripts server at localhost:3001 => which is how you open up the app in the browser
