Hario V-60 Dripper is just for you! This Japanese gadget allows you to make the most of your coffee in a simple and effective way. The filter method is great fun and allows for experimenting with coffee. Surprise your friends with rich taste and aroma of coffee, and the technique of its preparation! Hario V60-01 allows you to brew 200 - 360 ml of coffee at a time, which is enough for a big mug or two smaller portions.\n\nThe plastic version is the least expensive choice among V-60 drippers. Still, it is not any worse from other versions in terms of taste sensations. In addition, its plastic body provides durability and comfort if you want to use Hario V-60 when travelling. Its conical form and special grooves on the inside of the dripper provide excellent water flow. To prepare delicious coffee you need freshly ground coffee of high quality, a filter, your favourite cup or server and scales. Put the filter in the dripper and put it on the vessel that you use for serving coffee. The infusion process takes only 3 - 4 minutes.\n\nAnother advantage of this method is extremely easy maintenance. After use, simply remove the filter and wash the dripper in running water or in a dishwasher.\n\nThe translation of Hario is \"the King of Glass,\" which perfectly reflects the achievements of the company. The brand was founded in 1921 and ever since it has been producing the highest quality products made of glass, ceramics and metal. The production process takes place in Japan along with the best environmental sustainability.",

            "description": "The Gabi Master A is an innovative, easy to use, and giving great results coffee dripper.\n\nThe most unique feature of The Gabi is its showerhead-like waterspout. The water flows through 16 holes, rinsing ground coffee evenly, which results in a more regular extraction. The brewer consists of 4 light, solid parts made of plastic: water container, spout, dripper, and saucer.\n\nBrewing is simple. Place the dripper with a paper filter on a cup and rinse the filter with hot water. Discard water, pour 15g of medium-ground coffee into the filter, connect all the elements, and pour 150ml of hot water into the water container. That's all you really have to do!\nThe water flows slowly into the spout element and slowly drips into the dripper. After about 3 minutes, 150ml of flavourful brew is ready! This brewing method eliminates the problem of proper water distribution from kettle and gives highly repetitive results.\n\nThe brewer is packed in a well-designed plastic box.",

Designed for skilled and demanding baristas.\n\nThe grinder is compact, equipped with a touch screen, and features a touch screen.\n\nUse\n\nAn intuitive touch screen makes every operation extremely easy. You can quickly set the dose, program two doses, and grind coffee continuously. \n\nGrinding\n\nMignon Filtro is dedicated for pour-over brewing methods. To set the coarseness, simply turn the micrometric regulation knob. Although it is stepless, it has a scale on it, which makes the whole process much easier. The grinding is precise and consistent. The most significant element here is the 55mm hardened steel burr. The outcome is about 1.9 - 2.5g/s.\n\nHow it's built\n\nMignon is also well-designed and well-fitted. It is available in a wide range of colourways. The body is made of metal, which makes it durable. A transparent, plastic hopper may hold up to 300g of beans.\n\nAdditional features:\n- 260 Watt / 1350 RPM engine.\n- ACE System reducing clumping and electrostatics.\n- Silent Technology - compared to the previous version, the grinder is more silent.\n- Made in Italy.",

Brew Pro version is dedicated specifically for pour-over brewing methods (V60, Chemex, AeroPress, Filter coffee machines). Designed for skilled and demanding baristas.\n\nThe grinder is compact, equipped with a touch screen, and features a touch screen.\n\nUse\n\nAn intuitive touch screen makes every operation extremely easy. You can quickly set the dose, program two doses, and grind coffee continuously. \n\nGrinding\n\nMignon Filtro is dedicated for pour-over brewing methods. To set the coarseness, simply turn the micrometric regulation knob. Although it is stepless, it has a scale on it, which makes the whole process much easier. The grinding is precise and consistent. The most significant element here is the 55mm hardened steel burr. The outcome is about 1.9 - 2.5g/s.\n\nHow it's built\n\nMignon is also well-designed and well-fitted. It is available in a wide range of colourways. The body is made of metal, which makes it durable. A transparent, plastic hopper may hold up to 300g of beans.\n\nAdditional features:\n- 260 Watt / 1350 RPM engine.\n- ACE System reducing clumping and electrostatics.\n- Silent Technology - compared to the previous version, the grinder is more silent.\n- Made in Italy.",

            "description": "KeepCup Brew is a series of reusable, ecological, colourful cups made of glass and plastic.\n\nCapacity 340 ml (12oz)\n\nColours:\n- Gray lid\n- White plug\n- Light gray band\n- Transparent cup\n\nKeepCups are reusable ecological cups which delight with their amazing design. They are lightweight, perfect to hold in your hand, made of glass and durable, non-toxic plastic. The unique design and diverse colour range make you stand out from the crowd. Decide what colour suits you and enjoy the taste of your tea or coffee in your favourite cup. KeepCup is perfect if you are often in a rush and drink coffee on the go. Remember that KeepCup is neither vacuum insulated nor leakproof - the idea of this Australian company was to create an ecological alternative for a paper cup.\n\nUsing KeepCup you affect the environment less every day. An interesting fact is that to create a single KeepCup you need the amount of material that would have been used to produce 20 disposable cups. All over the world, every minute, about a million disposable cups get to the landfill. Unlike KeepCup, many of them cannot be recycled. Solve this problem - choose KeepCup!\n\nThe cups (without the lid) are dishwasher-safe and microwave-safe.",

            "description": "KeepCup Brew is a series of reusable, ecological, colourful cups made of glass and plastic.\n\nCapacity: 340 ml (12oz)\n\nColours:\n- Turquoise lid\n- Yellow plug\n- Pink band\n- Transparent cup\n\nKeepCups are reusable ecological cups which delight with their amazing design. They are lightweight, perfect to hold in your hand, made of glass and durable, non-toxic plastic. The unique design and diverse colour range make you stand out from the crowd. Decide what colour suits you and enjoy the taste of your tea or coffee in your favourite cup. KeepCup is perfect if you are often in a rush and drink coffee on the go. Remember that KeepCup is neither vacuum insulated, nor leakproof - the idea of this Australian company was to create an ecological alternative for a paper cup.\n\nUsing KeepCup you affect the environment less every day. An interesting fact is that to create a single KeepCup you need the amount of material that would have been used to produce 20 disposable cups. All over the world, every minute, about a million disposable cups get to the landfill. Unlike KeepCup, many of them cannot be recycled. Solve this problem - choose KeepCup!\n\nThe cups (without the lid) are dishwasher-safe and microwave-safe.",

Although the beans are dark roasted, they keep their clear and intense aroma. This coffee has a smoky flavour with a slight hint of sweetness and loads of fruit notes.\nThanks to the experience in the dark roasting of coffee, the beans still retain most of their aromas. Its aftertaste is clear and remains for a long time. This coffee is perfect for a Dripper, French Press, Moka coffee maker and the traditional espresso brewing method.\n\nThis edition consists of:\n- Brazil Primavera\n- El Salvador Menendez 84+\n- Burundi Aahore Blend\n- Burundi Long Miles Gaharo EX\n\nBrand:\tJohan & Nyström\nPackage:\t500 g\nWhole bean / Ground Coffee:\tWhole bean\nArabica / Robusta:\t100% Arabica\nRoast level:\tdark\nBrewing method:\tPour over and espresso",
